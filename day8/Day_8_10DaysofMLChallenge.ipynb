              "       'I was contacted on XX/XX/XXXX email by XXXX from Caliber Home Loans to refinance my current loan with them. I replied on XX/XX/XXXX he gave me an acceptable estimate for refinancing my condo which was already mortgaged with Caliber. XXXX then proceeded to try to get me to refinance my primary home. He presented another favorable quote so I proceeded. We started the process and got both appraisals done and I provided all of the requested documents. The appraisals came back lower than the estimates so XXXX reworked the estimates and I approved and we moved on. This all happened before XXXX. I got a call from my first loan processor XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX herself and stating she was beginning the next phase of my loans. I have never heard another word from XXXX. I began trying to get a status of my loans on XX/XX/XXXX to allow extra time for the holidays. I called and emailed both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Neither of them EVER replied or returned my phone calls. I tried emailing and calling multiple times every day. I called their main number but they were useless. I tried logging onto my account to check the status of my loans but I could n\\'t even access my account because of some IT problem they were having. I finally got someone on the XXXX number to give me someone else \\'s number. So I started calling XXXX who was supposedly XXXX boss but he never called me back either. On XX/XX/XXXX I got a call back from XXXX and he has been the most responsive but he has gone silent since the holidays. I was then assigned a new loan processor XX/XX/XXXX who basically started all over. I was told my new loan details after the appraisals came back lower were never entered into their system even though I had signed the new loans before XXXX. XXXX sent new estimates and my closing costs were higher even though I was borrowing less. XXXX said it was because my properties were entered as something other than condos and the condo closing costs are higher. He also refused to reimburse me for the appraisals. He said I would get \" credit for paying \\'\\' them at closing but I would not get reimbursed as XXXX had told me. He also is not honoring the lender credit I was given. I had locked in my interest rates which expired on XX/XX/2017. Supposedly Caliber extended the rate lock until XX/XX/XXXX but I have only received an email about the rate lock. I have not seen any official documentation. Late last week XXXX said there is a problem with the HOA on my primary property because of pending litigation but that it could still be handled and I could close on both properties if the right departments from Caliber was involved. I have not heard a word from XXXX since and the only communication I received at all was from XXXX \\'s boss yesterday in an informal email about my rate lock extension. \\nI know this is a lengthy story but here are my complaints : 1. Deceitful marketing practices. I am confident XXXX intentionally entered my properties into their system as something other than condos to make the deals more attractive in order to get me to refinance. The reason I am confident is because they already hold the loan on one of my properties. \\n2. Not honoring the agreement of reimbursing me for the appraisals and not giving me the lender credit as promised. \\n3. The total and complete lack of professionalism in their lack of communication with their customer, me.

Beneficial did file a mortgage on ,on the property. I am just outraged at this point that I took out a loan on my home, yet it wa never deeded in my name a one of the rightful owners. Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I wa the rightful owner of this property prior towhen my child quit claimed their father interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads andover customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from- 12months to refinance, because the property I have owned for overyears and paying on for over 20years is considered inheritance since it wa just quit claimed to me .',\n",

              " 'Was a happycard member for years, in late 2016converted the card portfolio to Barclaycard (). We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to inand Barclay ha been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous month then they charged us% of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an% apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchase at%, that is the equivalent of an% interest charge. I feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, fromto Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the point we acquired in previous years. Completely unfair and is why the big financials have the hated reputation they have now. Hope you folk over there can investigate.']"
